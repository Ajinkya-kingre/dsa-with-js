# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript. DSA is a fundamental concept in computer science that every programmer should be familiar with, as it forms the backbone of many software solutions.

## About

In this repository, I'll be exploring various data structures and algorithms, understanding their concepts, and implementing them in JavaScript. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of how different data structures work and how various algorithms operate on them efficiently.

## Contents

- **Data Structures:** Implementation of commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms:** Implementation of classic algorithms for sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Problem-solving:** Solving coding problems and challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others.
